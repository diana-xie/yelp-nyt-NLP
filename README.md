# yelp-nyt-NLP
An NLP project that integrates Yelp and New York Times restaurant reviews for NYC.

## Background / Pitch
The digital space is crucial to bringing business to restaurants, and many platforms exist for broadcasting food opinions that affect this bottom line. These platforms are so diverse and numerous that it may seem impossible to disentangle whether a single mention by a large news organization, such as the New York Times, or positive early reviews by customers on Yelp, are responsible for kicking off a restaurant’s success. 

Profit margins are already notoriously slim and closures a regular occurrence in the competitive and stressful restaurant industry, and making headway towards this goal could allow restaurants to better adapt to the changing ways with which people consume, share, and decide where to spend their dollars in the food industry.

## Project

### Determine patterns in the timeline of restaurant reviews (Yelp and NYT). 

Compile reviews, mentions, and shares across two platforms: 1) a crowd-sourced, social media platform: Yelp, and 2) a more traditional, professional critic news outlet: New York Times, to determine whether patterns within and between these platforms help popularize local restaurants. 

Within-platform patterns include a 4/5 or 5/5 by a well-known, professional NYT restaurant critic, or an initial wave of >4 star reviews on Yelp during a restaurant’s opening weeks. Between-platform patterns include whether the aforementioned early success on Yelp increases the likelihood that NYT will pick up on the establishment and write a positive review, or vice versa. 

### Apply NLP/sentiment analysis. 

Determine whether NYT and Yelp reviews influence each other, and whether certain word frequencies tend to correlate with positive/negative reviews. Influence between platforms (between NYT and Yelp) is determined by tracking frequently used words in Yelp reviews and whether this pattern changes after the onset of a NYT review (or vice versa).
